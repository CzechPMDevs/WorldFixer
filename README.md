This plugin is useful if you use large map from PC version. Because there are rails instead of slabs and black grass sometimes.

1. Select an area with /wf wand and break two blocks
2. Run command /wf fix or /wf fixslabs

#### Commands:
        /fix - set grass color to green and replace all cakes/rails with wooden slabs
        /fixcolor - set grass color to green
        /fixslabs - replace all cakes/rails with wooden slabs
        

#### Known Bugs:
- If you edit a large area, editing causes server lag (duration is depending on your server performance)

- If you change grass color, you must go to another level and go back or log out and join again
